          <p>Kou Yamori seems like a typical middle school student on the surface. Relatively good at studies and
            amiable with his classmates, he puts a lot of effort into maintaining this facade. One day, however, he
            decides to stop pretending and quits school, developing insomnia as a result of having no daytime outlet for
            his energy. When taking walks alone at night, he feels marginally better, though he is aware that his
            inability to sleep should be considered a serious problem.</p>
